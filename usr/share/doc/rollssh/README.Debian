ROLLSSH â€” MASSIVE WARNING / README
=================================

THIS SOFTWARE CONTAINS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS CAPABILITIES WHEN USED INCORRECTLY.
IT IS INTENDED ONLY FOR USE BY EXPERIENCED SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS ON SYSTEMS THEY OWN.

Installation behavior:
- debconf presents a non-interactive note summarising the risks, followed by a checkbox to acknowledge it.
- You can opt to keep the packaged defaults or provide custom usernames, passwords, key paths, and remote endpoint.
- Consent for FixCraft Inc. access is captured through a debconf boolean question. When defaults are kept, consent is
  recorded in /etc/rollssh/consent; otherwise the permission is passed as a CLI flag.
- A final debconf confirmation must be set to "Yes" (or preseeded to true) for the installer to run.

All prompts honour the selected debconf frontend. For unattended installs, preseed the questions documented under
the rollssh/* namespace and run with DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive.

DO NOT install on machines you do not own or administer.
