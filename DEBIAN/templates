Template: rollssh/warning
Type: note
Description: rollssh requires explicit administrator consent
 This package configures privileged SSH helpers and reverse tunnels.
 Improper use can leave this system permanently exposed. Proceed only if
 you are the legitimate administrator and fully understand the risks.

Template: rollssh/acknowledge-warning
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you acknowledge the rollssh warning?
 Selecting "Yes" confirms that you have read and understood the
 previous warning. Installation will abort if this acknowledgement is
 not provided. You can preseed this value with "true" to allow
 unattended installs.

Template: rollssh/mode
Type: select
Choices: SAFE, RECKLESS
Default: RECKLESS
Description: Choose the rollssh operation mode
 SAFE disables the destructive automation and forces local-owner
 protections (`--own`). RECKLESS keeps the upstream defaults, including
 remote destructive helpers. Pick SAFE unless you fully control the
 target system and accept the risk.

Template: rollssh/use-defaults
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Use the packaged default rollssh settings?
 Accepting the defaults keeps the upstream usernames, key paths, and
 remote endpoint. Choosing "No" will prompt for custom values that are
 passed to the bundled installer.

Template: rollssh/admin1-name
Type: string
Default: root
Description: Primary administrator username
 This account owns the root-side private key that establishes the
 reverse tunnel. Leave empty to keep the default value.

Template: rollssh/admin1-pass
Type: password
Description: Password for the primary administrator (optional)
 Provide a replacement password for the primary administrator account.
 Leave this empty to keep the installer default.

Template: rollssh/admin2-name
Type: string
Default: akari
Description: Secondary administrator username
 This non-root account is created (if needed) to host the secondary
 key material. Leave empty to keep the default value.

Template: rollssh/admin2-pass
Type: password
Description: Password for the secondary administrator (optional)
 Provide a replacement password for the secondary administrator
 account. Leave this empty to keep the installer default.

Template: rollssh/rsa-path
Type: string
Default: /etc/ssh/id_rsa
Description: Path to the FixCraft RSA public key
 This location is either fetched from the network or copied from a
 local file if you pass an absolute path.

Template: rollssh/ed25519-path
Type: string
Default: /etc/ssh/id_ed25519
Description: Path to the FixCraft Ed25519 public key
 This location is either fetched from the network or copied from a
 local file if you pass an absolute path.

Template: rollssh/privkey-path
Type: string
Default: /etc/ssh/id_ed25519
Description: Path to the FixCraft private key material
 Provide a local path to copy, or leave the default to download the
 packaged upstream private key.

Template: rollssh/remote-url
Type: string
Default: https://example.remote:443
Description: Remote management API endpoint
 This URL determines where the installer requests dynamic tunnel
 assignments. It should include the protocol and optional port.

Template: rollssh/allow-fixcraft
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Permit FixCraft Inc. remote access?
 Select "Yes" to record consent for FixCraft Inc. to access this
 system. When defaults are used, a consent stamp is written to
 /etc/rollssh/consent; otherwise a command-line flag is passed to the
 installer.

Template: rollssh/confirm-run
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Final confirmation to run the rollssh installer
 The packaged installer performs invasive system changes. Choose "Yes"
 to proceed or "No" to abort. You must explicitly set this to "true"
 (via an interactive frontend or by preseed) for the installation to
 continue.
